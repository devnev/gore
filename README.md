# GoRe â€” a Go regexp toolbelt

Written out of annoyance with the many different regexp syntaxes and escaping requirements in sed, grep, etc.

Intended to cover the most common use-cases without any magical flags.

## Install

* Install Go
* `go get nevill.io/gore`

## Commands

All commands traverse directories recursively.

All patterns use RE2 syntax (https://golang.org/s/re2syntax).

All patterns are applied line-by-line.

All replacements may reference matched groups with `$name` or `${name}` (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.Expand)

```
find|list|ls <pattern> [<path...>]
  find file and directories with names matching pattern.  
search <pattern> [<path...>]
  list files with lines matching the pattern.
print|p|grep <pattern> [<path...>]
  print lines matching pattern.
replace|re|sub|s <pattern> <replacement> <path>
  replace occurrences of pattern with replacement.
delete|d <pattern> <path...>
  delete liens matching pattern.
rename <pattern> <replacement> <path>
  replace occurrences of pattern in file and directory names with replacement.
```
